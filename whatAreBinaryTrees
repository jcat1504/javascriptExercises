A binary tree is made of nodes, where each node contains a "left" reference, a "right" reference and a data element.
the topmost node in the tree is called the root


every node(excluding root) in a tree is connected by a directed edge from exactly one other node.
Node is called a parent 
On the other hand, node can be connected to arbitrary number of nodes, called children
Nodes with no children are LEAVES or EXTERNAL NODES
Nodes which are not leaves are internal nodes
Nodes with same parent are called SIBLINGS
